## Description
The goal of this project is to create ToDo List that has CRUD functionality. The steps to complete this project follow:

## Steps to Create 
* Create initial ToDo list files index.html, style.css, and index.js
* Add input form then create a function to add new items to the list
* Create a function to remove items from the list
* Refactor the ToDo list app so form functionality is moved into a new component
* Refactor again by moving ToDo functionality into a second new component

## How to Run
* To run, open ___index.html___.
* Add a new list item by entering text in the *Add ToDo*
* Remove an item from the list by clicking on the item


## Roadmap of Future Improvements
Add functionality to crossout the item rather than removing from list


## Learning Insights

Learning how create a working ToDo List was pretty fun. Also working through the refactoring process with Dr. Abel made it easier to understand how to code into separate component files as well as the intent, so it can be used with different projects.
